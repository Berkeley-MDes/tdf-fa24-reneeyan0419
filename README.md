# Week 3 #
## Week of 09/19/2024

(09.16 Mon)I finished my cellphone stand design and made a test print. And I am not satisfied with it is because of the stability. The height of the front toast was too low and kept causing my phone to falling down. So the next modification I made is to make the toast thicker.

I am really satisfied with it, and it works very well. I've never made any 3D printing stuff started from CAD modeling by myself. Reflecting on this three-week exploration, I have learned a lot about Grasshopper and Rhino. I watched many tutorials and tried to figure out many problems I met during the process. 

Speculations:
I was thinking one of the questions from the report that how Systems thinking and computational design tools can change the way we perceive and interact with our environment.
I think design, in general, will increasingly prioritize aspects that were previously difficult to consider simultaneously, such as sustainability and individual adaptability. This shift could lead to changes in cultural expectations, where, when designing similar products, target users may shift from a large community to a small group, and eventually narrow down to an individual.

## Week of 09/12/2024
1. Getting familiar with Rhino and Grasshopper

I tried to adjust the sliders and play around with the cellphone stand file at first.

2. On Monday, I went to the 3D printing group and learned how to do the 3D printing from nice TAs. I baked the cellphone stand, exported as a STL file, connected the printer and learned about adding a brim through the Prusaslicer. We even went to the studio together to see how to use the printer.

3. Learn more about Rhino and Grasshopper
   
   I tried to follow a tutorial video on Youtube (One of the classmates shared this to us and it helped a lot) and tried to make a box with a lid.

Reflection: 
I had never used any software like this before, and the experience of going through such a systematic design process was really unpredictable. I watched a bunch of tutorial videos on YouTube and realized that none of them could solve the problems I encountered during the process. It’s interesting that this is a highly personalized project, morever, the challenges I faced were also unique. Exploring the functions and figuring out how Grasshopper works was fun.

Speculations:
I studied at an art school where breaking rules and embracing creativity was essential. At first, systematic design tools like Grasshopper and Rhino seemed restrictive, but they’ve reshaped my view of creativity. I’ve learned that structure and parameters don’t limit creativity; they enhance it by providing new ways to explore, iterate, and refine ideas. This blend of intuition and precision has shown me that creativity thrives within a framework, expanding the possibilities in design.

1. This week I watched some tutorials about Rhino and Grasshopper on Youtube

2. And I also tried to figure out how to post on Github

3. There's one news I found interesting is Facial Recognition Company Clearview AI Fined €30.5M for GDPR Violations.

AI's rapid development has caused widespread discussion and concern. Many believe that the pace of AI is exceeding government's ability to keep up. I think one of the key reasons for this is that government just began to regulate AI for safe and ethical use which lags behind the technology's advancements. AI technologies such as ChatGPT have opened a new possibility and convenience for human. Facial recognition offers a quick method of authentication, like unlocking phones, accessing secure locations, and making payments. It really improved the user experience. However, there's a duality there. As with any technology involving personal data, facial recognition systems are vulnerable to hacking , which can result in the theft or misuse of sensitive biometric information. Clearview's violation illustrates the need for stricter controls on how companies gather sensitive data. The fact that they scraped images without permission undermines basic privacy rights.
