I worked with my teammate, Hongxi, to explore a variety of sensors in our project. The light sensor performed exceptionally well, providing accurate and consistent data, and integrating it into our system was smooth and efficient. However, when it came to the gravity sensor, there were a lot of challenges. I kept getting error in the VS Code, so my next plan is to figure out what's causing the error and fix it.

Speculation:
Getting the light sensor to work so smoothly was nice, but the gravity sensor has been a headache with all the errors in VS Code. These challenges might push us to try new ways of debugging and thinking through problems. It's nice to explore more on particle photon.

This week, I went through the provided files and explored two STEMMA-based sensors. I encountered a few issues along the way, which required me to adjust the script multiple times to ensure proper functionality. 

Reflecting on this experience, it helped me deepen my understanding of both the hardware and the coding aspects of the project. I gained more confidence in adapting code to handle unexpected behaviors. These challenges have also highlighted the importance of anticipating potential issues in future projects, so I can better plan for troubleshooting and debugging.

We have also begun to gather as a group to brainstorm ideas for Project 2. Deciding on specific topics to explore in-depth has been challenging, as we are excited by the wide range of possibilities. The goal of this project is to develop an interactive "Book of Answers" installation that responds to user input by utilizing Particle Photon 2 devices for processing and communication. Sensors and actuators will facilitate dynamic, real-time interactions, allowing the user to experience a seamless blend of technology and art. Through this project, we aim to explore the creative potential of IoT technology in interactive installations and enhance the user’s experience with real-time, sensor-driven responses.

Speculation:
As we dive into this project, I am excited by the opportunity to push the boundaries of interactive technology. I wish to learn more about how IoT devices, sensors, and real-time data can create dynamic, responsive experiences.I think this project will help us deepen our understanding of how people interact with digital systems and expand our creative thinking.

Started from Monday,I began exploring Particle Photon by reviewing the first 6 files. It's been really interesting since I've never used anything like this before, and exploring how it all works has been pretty fun. After going through those files, I got a much clearer idea of how Particle Photon works, so I decided to dive into some more complicated ones (posted on Github) to see what else I could do.

I went through three tutorials step-by-step (button to LED pulse rate, FSR to LED color, and button send on change), and it feels like I'm really exploring what these tools can do and how their functionality works. I ran into a few problems along the way, both with the coding and the assembly parts. It was a bit tricky, but part of the learning process.

Speculations:
I envision a system that automatically adjusts factors like temperature, lighting, and air quality based on real-time data and personal habits to create a personalized comfort environment. For example, the system might learn that cooler air and dim lighting are better for concentration or relaxation and adjust accordingly. In Professor High's class, we also discussed personalization and customization, and I believe the shift from manual customization to automatic personalization is inevitable. As technology and tools develop, people will be able to create environments that better suit their individual needs.

# Week 4 #
## Week of 09/26/2024
For this week, I wrapped up my first project. I spent most of the time reviewing peer feedback and finishing my report. I really appreciate all the feedback I received; it was super useful.

And we also started brainstorming our second project, the "Digital Ecosystem." I have never done something like this before, and I am really excited about the project. I'm also a little bit worried about the technology behind it, but since it's a group project, I'm looking forward to learning from my group members.

For this week's assignment, I decided to create a smart home ecosystem map based on my own experience. The development of technology has really changed our lives. By using smart devices, I can control almost everything in my home.

Speculations:
Since I decided to focus on smart homes this week, I started thinking about what the future could look like. I think smart homes could turn into super responsive environments that learn from us, making everything more comfortable, secure, and energy-efficient without us having to lift a finger. But as cool as that sounds, the rise of interconnected systems also brings up the usual concerns about privacy, data security, and how much we rely on technology. It’s always that same question popping up with any new technology. Finding the right balance between the perks of smart ecosystems and the ethical and security stuff is going to be key. Projects like the 'Digital Ecosystem' push us to think about how we can design tech that makes life better while keeping these challenges in mind.

## Week of 09/19/2024

(09.16 Mon)I finished my cellphone stand design and made a test print. And I am not satisfied with it is because of the stability. The height of the front toast was too low and kept causing my phone to falling down. So the next modification I made is to make the toast thicker.

My Grasshopper design diagrams:
![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c6dcb6b-fa68-4365-b48e-916b805d66b6)

I am really satisfied with it, and it works very well. I've never made any 3D printing stuff started from CAD modeling by myself. Reflecting on this three-week exploration, I have learned a lot about Grasshopper and Rhino. I watched many tutorials and tried to figure out many problems I met during the process. 

Speculations:
I was thinking one of the questions from the report that how Systems thinking and computational design tools can change the way we perceive and interact with our environment.
I think design, in general, will increasingly prioritize aspects that were previously difficult to consider simultaneously, such as sustainability and individual adaptability. This shift could lead to changes in cultural expectations, where, when designing similar products, target users may shift from a large community to a small group, and eventually narrow down to an individual.



# Week 2 #
## Week of 09/12/2024
1. Getting familiar with Rhino and Grasshopper

I tried to adjust the sliders and play around with the cellphone stand file at first.

2. On Monday, I went to the 3D printing group and learned how to do the 3D printing from nice TAs. I baked the cellphone stand, exported as a STL file, connected the printer and learned about adding a brim through the Prusaslicer. We even went to the studio together to see how to use the printer.

3. Learn more about Rhino and Grasshopper
   
   I tried to follow a tutorial video on Youtube (One of the classmates shared this to us and it helped a lot) and tried to make a box with a lid.

Reflection: 
I had never used any software like this before, and the experience of going through such a systematic design process was really unpredictable. I watched a bunch of tutorial videos on YouTube and realized that none of them could solve the problems I encountered during the process. It’s interesting that this is a highly personalized project, morever, the challenges I faced were also unique. Exploring the functions and figuring out how Grasshopper works was fun.

Speculations:
I studied at an art school where breaking rules and embracing creativity was essential. At first, systematic design tools like Grasshopper and Rhino seemed restrictive, but they’ve reshaped my view of creativity. I’ve learned that structure and parameters don’t limit creativity; they enhance it by providing new ways to explore, iterate, and refine ideas. This blend of intuition and precision has shown me that creativity thrives within a framework, expanding the possibilities in design.

1. This week I watched some tutorials about Rhino and Grasshopper on Youtube

2. And I also tried to figure out how to post on Github

3. There's one news I found interesting is Facial Recognition Company Clearview AI Fined €30.5M for GDPR Violations.

AI's rapid development has caused widespread discussion and concern. Many believe that the pace of AI is exceeding government's ability to keep up. I think one of the key reasons for this is that government just began to regulate AI for safe and ethical use which lags behind the technology's advancements. AI technologies such as ChatGPT have opened a new possibility and convenience for human. Facial recognition offers a quick method of authentication, like unlocking phones, accessing secure locations, and making payments. It really improved the user experience. However, there's a duality there. As with any technology involving personal data, facial recognition systems are vulnerable to hacking , which can result in the theft or misuse of sensitive biometric information. Clearview's violation illustrates the need for stricter controls on how companies gather sensitive data. The fact that they scraped images without permission undermines basic privacy rights.
