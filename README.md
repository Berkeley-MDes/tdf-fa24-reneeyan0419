AI's rapid development has caused widespread discussion and concern. Many believe that the pace of AI is exceeding government's ability to keep up. I think one of the key reasons for this is that government just began to regulate AI for safe and ethical use which lags behind the technology's advancements. AI technologies such as ChatGPT have opened a new possibility and convenience for human. Facial recognition offers a quick method of authentication, like unlocking phones, accessing secure locations, and making payments. It really improved the user experience. However, there's a duality there. As with any technology involving personal data, facial recognition systems are vulnerable to hacking , which can result in the theft or misuse of sensitive biometric information. Clearview's violation illustrates the need for stricter controls on how companies gather sensitive data. The fact that they scraped images without permission undermines basic privacy rights.
